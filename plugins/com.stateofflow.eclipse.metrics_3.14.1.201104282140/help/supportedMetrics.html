        <p>It is the aim of this plugin to provide an indication of the health of your codebase. The metrics chosen are therefore those for which
        	it is possible to choose a range of values which may be considered 'reasonable' and to highlight those parts of the code that do
        	not conform to those reasonable ranges. It is specifically not the aim of this plugin to provide a vast array of numbers describing
        	your codebase. Instead, it is the aim to provide a small number of metrics such that:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>there is an unambiuous interpretation of the meaning of the metrics. Admittedly, some of the cohesion metrics may not fit
        		this criterion.</li>
        	<li>there is general agreement that excessive values need to be remedied even if there is disagreement about what is deemed
        		'excessive'.</li>
        	<li>remedial actions are relatively obvious and straightforward.</li>
        </ul>
