Version    Changes
3.14.1     Corrected some typos in the help pages.
3.14.0     Added XML export format.
3.13.0     Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException thrown during CSV generation
           when instance initializers are encountered.
           Allowed more than one resource to be selected when exporting
           metrics. Takes the project of the first selected item.
3.12.0     Removed Oro regex jar. Use one provided in JDK instead.
           Fix bug when Feature Envy metric tries to resolve unresolvable
           bindings for a SimpleName.
           Fixed bug in Number of Locals In Scope metric that caused an
           exception in static and instance initializers.
3.11.0     Added Feature Envy metric.
3.10.0     Moved most of the documentation from SourceForge to embedded
           help.
           Exported HTML now includes metrics descriptions and a stylesheet
           rather than linking to pages on SourceForge.
3.9.0      Switch to JDK 1.5.
           Exported metrics can now have links to HTMLised renderings of the
           source, either when exporting using the Eclipse Export Wizard or
           using the Ant task with the htmlJava attribute.
3.8.0      Extended the eclipse-metrics.export ant task with an optional
           FileSet child element called compilationUnit, to allow control
           over what is exported without configuring excludes through the
           Eclipse UI.           
3.7.0      Added an ant task for exporting metrics using a headless build.
           Correct change introduced in 3.6.0 to avoid a NullPointerException
           if bindings cannot be resolved.
           Corrected a reference to the MetricsMarker markertype.
           Added Pairwise Field Irrelation option for LCOM metric.
           Added Number Of Locals In Scope metric.
3.6.0      Allowed Number of Parameters calculator to exclude methods that are
           declared on a supertype.
3.5.1      Corrected a bug that prevents the number of rows per page in the HTML
           export from being retrieved from the persisted preferences.
3.5.0      Fixed bug 1873551. HTML Export with Histograms and Dashboard causes a 
           ClassCastException.
           Jochen corrected a minor bug in the ignoring of blank lines in the
           LoC metric.
           Jochen also added a new summary page in the HTML export that lists total
           number of packages, classes and lines of code.
3.4.0      Added Total Correlation Lack of Cohesion metric.
           Use the line number of the type name for type metric locations instead
           of the beginning of JavaDoc.
           Jochen Wuttke supplied a patch to ignore blank and comment-only lines
           for the LoC metric. Checking this option in the Metrics preferences
           will not count lines meeting the following criteria:
               1. lines containing only whitespace
               2. lines containing only comments
               3. lines containing only brackets and curly braces
               4. lines containing only a single operator
           According to Jochen, the first three are intentional, the last one
           comes with the way Eclipse builds the AST. Many thanks, Jochen.
3.3.1      Add support for JDK 1.5 / Java 5 / Tiger etc enums.
           Histogram support on OS X appears to be broken again. This is a problem
           with the Eclipse OS X implementation.
           Use the metrics icon in the vertical ruler, rather than the default
           warning triangle. I'm not sure how to get this icon to appear in the
           Problems view, or in the various Java views (Projects, Packages, Types,
           etc).
           Added Eclipse Metrics properties page when the Properties dialog is
           launched from non-Java views.
3.3.0      Allowed discounting of JavaDoc comments in the Lines Of Code metric.
           Fixed a bug when excluding resources using regexes.
3.2.0      Refactored to allow creation of an Ant task.
           Link metrics descriptions to pages on SourceForge to make it easier
           to create the Ant task.
           Histograms now supported on OS X
3.1.0      Added handling of J2SE 5.0 enhanced FOR loop for relevant metrics.
3.0.1      Fixed some incorrect/broken links in index.html
3.0.0      Compatible with Eclipse version 3.1. Still uses some deprecated
           APIs.
           Repackaged as com.stateofflow.eclipse.metrics and placed on
           SourceForge.
           Refactored many things to improved the code.
           Packaged up the metric descriptions with the release and place them
           into the export folder when an HTML export is performed.
2.7.0      Compatible with Eclipse version 3.0.
2.6.1      Rebuilt in an attempt to fix some loading problems. I'm not sure that
           this was necessary since I think Eclipse bug 48220 was actually causing
           the problem. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=48220
2.6.0      Made compatible with Eclipse version 3.0M7.
           Also fixed a problem that was causing incremental builds not to cause
           metrics recalculation. This was due to the background compilation that
           was introduced in an earlier 3.0M release.
2.5.0      Made compatible with Eclipse version 3.0M5 and 3.0M6.
           Fixed a bug reported by Jussi Helminen whereby the line numbers used
           for the first line of types was calculated differently for the Lack of
           Cohesion in Methods from the other metrics. This caused exports to
           behave oddly when these metrics were included.
2.4.0      Made compatible with Eclipse version 3.0.0.
2.3.0      Added the CSV export facility.
           Added histograms for each metric page using JFreeChart. Warning: For
           reasons currently under investigation, the histogram production causes
           Eclipse on MacOS X and Linux to crash after the export has completed.
           This problem does not occur on Windows. If you experience it on other
           platforms please submit a bug on SourceForge.
           Added a dashboard visual summary using the histograms.
2.2.1      Small refactoring to try to reduce the memory requirements when
           exporting metrics.
2.2.0      Internal reorganisation in the way metrics are identified. Results in a
           slight speedup when metrics are disabled.
           Added Lines of Code in Method metric.
           Fixed a bug in Number of Statements that caused variable assignments
           not to be counted.
           Corrected an error in the Henderson-Sellers Lack of Cohesion in Methods
           description. This was found by Andreas Schonknecht. Many thanks,
           Andreas.
2.1.0      Allow paging of output when exporting HTML (with user definable number
           of rows)
           Persist export information (directory and number of rows per page) in
           the project and recall it next time.
2.0.1      Fixed a bug that caused metrics to be produced for projects which a
           metrics-enabled project is dependent on.
           Fixed a bug in the Lack Of Cohesion In Methods Calculator that caused
           exceptions when files were replaced with items from the local history
           or from CVS.
2.0.0      Refactored the calculators to use Eclipse's build in AST rather than
           one generated by Antlr. This took a while and slightly impacts
           performance but should make it much easier to add new metrics.
           Added Efferent Couplings metric.
1.4.0      Added HTML Export. Added Perl5 regexes (using the Jakarta-ORO packages)
           as a mechanism for excluding resources from metric calculations.
           Allowed editing of existing resource specifications in the Excluded
           Resources list.
           Changed FileDialog in Excluded Resources to a ResourceSelectionDialog.
1.3.1      Fixed a bug in Lack of Cohesion in Methods that causes a
           NullPointerException when a field is initialized at the same time as it
           is declared.
           Remove Metrics Properties item from Resource Perspective and add it to
           all Java Perspectives i.e. you now enable and disable metrics gathering
           from the Properties sheet in a Java perspective).
1.3.0      Allow enabling and disabling of individual metrics in the Preference
           page.
           Allow enabling and disabling of counting of case, catch and ternary
           operator in Cyclomatic Complexity and Weighted Methods Per Class.
           Only show the package when measuring metrics rather than the Java file.
1.2.0      Walk the AST generated by Antlr with hand crafted code rather than
           using semantic actions in the grammar. I think this is easier. Might
           still use transformations and semantics actions later though...
           Added Chidamber and Kimerer Lack of Cohesion in Methods.
           Added Henderson-Sellers Lack of Cohesion in Methods.
           Added Number of Fields
           Added Number of Statements
           Fixed Excluded Resources (again)
1.1.1      Bugfix for Excluded Resources - couldn't add just one resource at a
           time (i.e. could add if more than one resource was selected). Now can
           add one or more resources.
           Removed parser logging - significant speedup.
1.1.0      Bugfix for errors during build of projects with project directory as
           source directory.
           Bugfix for Preferences problem caused by removal of IntegerFieldEditor
           constructor in Eclipse 2.0.2
           Added Excluded Resources list in the project Properties.
           Added Weighted Methods Per Class
1.0.0      First release
