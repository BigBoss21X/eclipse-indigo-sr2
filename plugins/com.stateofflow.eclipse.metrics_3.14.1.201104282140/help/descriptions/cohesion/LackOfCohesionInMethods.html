        <p>Cohesion is an important concept in OO programming. It indicates whether a class represents a single abstraction or multiple abstractions.
        	The idea is that if a class represents more than one abstraction, it should be refactored into more than one class, each of which
        	represents a single abstraction.</p>
        <p>Despite its importance, it is difficult to establish a clear mechanism for measuring it. This is probably due to the fact that good
        	abstractions have deep semantics and a class that is clearly cohesive when viewed from a semantic point of view may not be so when
        	viewed from a purely symbolic point of view.</p>
        <p>As an aside, the somewhat inelegant name is due to the wish to have lower metric values representing a 'better' situation.</p>
        <p>I have selected four definitions of lack of cohesion. That of Chidamber and Kemerer, that of Henderson-Sellers, and two of my own.</p>

        <p><b>Note 1:</b> I have only included methods if they access at least one field.</p>
        <p><b>Note 2:</b> I have only included fields if they are accessed by at least one method in the class.</p>
