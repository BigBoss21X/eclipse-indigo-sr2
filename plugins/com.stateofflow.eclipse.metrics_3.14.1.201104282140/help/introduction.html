        <p>This plugin calculates various metrics for your code during build cycles and warns you, via the Problems view, of 'range violations' for each metric. 
       		This allows you to stay continuously aware of the health of your code base.</p>
       	<p>You may also <a href="export.html" title="Exporting Metrics">export</a> the metrics to <a href="http://eclipse-metrics.sourceforge.net/example/index.html"
       		title="Exported metrics for the eclipse-metrics codebase">HTML</a> for public display or to CSV or XML for further analysis.</p>
        <p>Note that although metrics can be useful in a software development effort, they should not take the place of good taste and experience. Also, metrics
        	are more useful as indicators of unhealthy code than they are as indicators of healthy code, <i>i.e.</i> a codebase with many range violation warnings
        	is probably an indication that the code needs to be refactored but no range violation warnings does <i>not</i> necessarily mean that the code is
        	good.</p>
